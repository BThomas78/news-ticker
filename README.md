# News Ticker (GitHub Pages)

A lightweight, free, iframe-embeddable **rolling news ticker** built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

This project is designed for use in platforms that restrict scripting or external embeds — such as **ArcGIS Hub** — where traditional news sites block iframe embedding.
